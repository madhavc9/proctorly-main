  <summary><b>Introduction</b></summary>
  <br>
  With the onset of COVID-19, students and teachers across the globe were forced to shift to online teaching. The lectures started being held over Google Meet or Zoom, but none of these platforms had a solution for proctoring online examinations.  
  Human proctors were unable to monitor each student carefully, leading to massive cheating and misconduct in exams.  

  **Our vision** was to develop an automated Artificial Intelligence-based proctoring system that:  
  - Replaces human proctors and ensures stricter monitoring  
  - Detects similarities in student submissions and reports them  
  - Reduces misconduct and maintains academic integrity

  <summary><b>Workflow</b></summary>
  <br>
  1. The teacher/university shares the exam link  
  2. Students log in to the website  
  3. ML models detect cheating attempts in real time  
  4. A log of suspicious activities is sent to the teacher/examiner  
  5. Students submit their exams  
  6. Answers are cross-checked for collaborative cheating  
  7. The final reports (with confidential info redacted) are sent to the teacher  
  8. The result is announced  
  9. **Outcome:** No cheating, benefiting both students and teachers!

  <summary><b>Explanation of the Models</b></summary>
  <br>
  1. **Mouth Movement Tracking:** Detects if a student speaks during the exam.  
  2. **Person Counting:** Detects the number of individuals in the room.  
  3. **Malicious Object Detection:** Identifies cheating materials (books, phones, notes, etc.).  
  4. **Answer Similarity Checker:** Identifies collaborative/direct copying in student responses.  
  5. **Speech Recognition Surveillance:** Detects spoken words related to the exam questions.  
  6. **Headphone Detection:** Checks if a student is using an audio device.  
  7. **Eye Tracking:** Monitors eye movements to detect suspicious behavior.

<details>
  <summary><b>Special Features</b></summary>
  <br>
  1. **Parallel Processing:** Multi-threaded models ensure low latency and high efficiency.  
  2. **Privacy-Focused:** No student data is stored; reports contain limited anonymized data.  
  3. **Zero Setup:** Students don’t need any additional hardware or software.  
  4. **Student-Centric:** Designed to be stress-free for students while ensuring fairness.  
  5. **Cost-Effective:** AI-based monitoring is cheaper than hiring human proctors.  
</details>
